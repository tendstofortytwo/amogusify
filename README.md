# amogusify

Firefox browser extension that replaces all occurrences of the word among with an amogus image.

## build

For development, load the manifest.json into `about:debugging`. For submission to addons.mozilla.org, running `make` will generate the XPI file.

## license

For the code, LICENSE.md. For `amogus.png`, hopefully considered fair use, copyright holder is presumably Innersloth (developer of Among Us). If you're Innersloth and don't like this, plese let me know.
